# Signal and Image Processing Labs

This repository contains the lab materials for the **Signal and Image Processing** course. Each lab focuses on a key concept in signal and image analysis, providing both theoretical background and practical implementation.

## Lab Topics

1. **Lab 1: Fourier Series**
   - Gibbs phenomenon
   - Computation of Fourier coefficients using FFT
   - Resolution of a differential equation using FFT

2. **Lab 2: Dirac Comb and Short-Term Spectrum**
   - Understanding and visualizing the Dirac comb
   - Computation of the short-term spectrum for non-stationary signals

3. **Lab 3: Spectrum Approximation and Filtering**
   - Techniques for spectrum approximation
   - Filter analysis
   - Using DFT for signal filtering

4. **Lab 4: Signal Windowing and Filtering**
   - Importance of signal windowing in processing
   - Low-pass filtering
   - Band-pass signal filtering

5. **Lab 5: Discrete Cosine Transform and JPEG**
   - Introduction to the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
   - Application of DCT in JPEG image compression

## Contents

For each lab, the following files are provided:
- **GoogleColab Notebook**: Contains the code implementations and demonstrations.
- **PDF Report**: Includes the theoretical background, mathematical derivations, and explanations of the results.

## Acknowledgments
